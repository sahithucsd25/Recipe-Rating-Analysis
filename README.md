# Recipe-Rating-Analysis
Project for DSC 80 at UCSD
## Introduction
This dataset contains information on recipes from 'food.com'. It contains over 80,000 recipes with data about a recipe's nutrition values (calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)), the number of ingredients needed, and it's average rating (1.0-5.0), among other values. The average rating was calculating by analyzing a separate dataset containing reviews and ratings for different recipes. 

In analyzing this dataset, a natural question that arises is as follows: Do recipes with higher-than-average sugar content have higher-than-average ratings?

Answering the above question using this dataset has immediate consequences. If the answer is 'yes', when searching for reputable recipes going forward, bear in mind that highly rated recipes tend to be sweeter on average.
